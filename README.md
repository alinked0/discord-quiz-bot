## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java 17+**
- **Maven**
- **A Discord bot token** ([how to get one](https://discord.com/developers/applications))

### Build

Clone the repository and build with Maven:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/alinked0/discord-quiz-bot
cd discord-quiz-bot
mvn package
```

This will generate the bot jar in the `target/` directory.

### Run

```sh
java -jar target/discordquizbot-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar BOTTOKEN USERID \[TESTCHANNELID TESTGUILDID\]
```

- **BOTTOKEN**: Your Discord bot token.
- **TESTGUILDID**: Discord server (guild) ID for testing.
- **TESTCHANNELID**: Channel ID for test messages.
- **USERID**: Your Discord user ID (for test mode).

If you run without arguments, the bot will prompt for your token.

## Question List Format

Question lists are stored as JSON files. Example:

```json
{
  "authorId": "123456789012345678",
  "name": "Sample Quiz",
  "id": "abcdefg",
  "timeCreatedMillis": 1700000000000,
  "emojiPerTagName": { "science": "ðŸ§ª" },
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is the chemical symbol for water?",
      "explication": "H2O is the chemical formula for water.",
      "imageSrc": null,
      "options": [
        { "text": "H2O", "isCorrect": true, "explication": null },
        { "text": "CO2", "isCorrect": false, "explication": null }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

You can import/export these lists using the bot commands.
